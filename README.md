You must provide a written project proposal. The proposal should contain:

    1.  List of the group members.
		- Jacob Sorenson
		- Jared Knight
	
    2.  High-level description of your application â€“ 4-5 lines of text.

If the user hits a wall the leds will be reset restarting the game.
		
    3.  Functional block diagram, containing all the hardware/software blocks of your project.

    4.  A list of 4 implementations milestones. The 4th milestone is due with the final delivery (afterfinals week).
		- Milestone 1: Create functioning gyroscope movement with expected screen bounds. Get Parts needed for project.
		- Milestone 2: Figure out Screen display and positioning of Items.
		- Milestone 3: Connect Gyroscope data to movement of ball.
		- Milestone 4: Trigger LED when target is met. Display winning screen.
