<b>High-level description of your application â€“ 4-5 lines of text.</b>

<p>A handheld game which uses a screen to display a ball that is able to roll around. By tilting 
the device the user is able to control the velcity of the ball. The objective of this game is 
to move the ball into target locations which will appear as previous targets are reached. The 
red LED (level 1) will begin blinking slowly, increading in frequency as targets are hit until 
it locks in solid moving onto the next level (green). Following the same pattern until green 
locks in and the game is won. If the user hits a wall the leds will be reset to the previous 
locked level.</p>
